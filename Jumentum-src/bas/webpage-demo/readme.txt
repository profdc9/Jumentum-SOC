This demo is a brief program that demonstrates serving web pages from an SD card.

To use it, program the device with the "serve.bas" program, and copy the "htdocs" directory into the root directory of an SD card.

The demo will serve html, text, and jpeg images from the SD card.  It is fairly
easy to add types to it.
