Jumentum-SOC (System on chip) is a programming environment for LPC2000-based microcontrollers.
It turns your LPC2000 with ENC28J60-based ethernet into an autonomous
controller that is remotely programmable through Ethernet
using a BASIC-derived language.  Jumentum-SOC can be accessed and programmed
through a web browser, a TELNET text-based session, and the first serial port.
Jumentum-SOC programs can be downloaded into the microcontroller and
programmed into the flash so that the programs are automatically run on
power up of the microcontroller.  The programs can be started, stopped,
paused, and the program variables inspected at any time through the web page.
<P>
Jumentum-SOC is written in C and a little ARM assembly language, and
is provided as a project for the free WinARM development environment.  The
portability of the code base has been maximized to promote adaptation to other
microcontrollers.  An LPC2000-based processor is currently required for Jumentum-SOC.
To build your own hardware capable of using Jumentum-SOC, one can use one of the setups
detailed in the "ENC28J60-wiring.txt" file included in this distribution.

Jumentum-SOC is provided under a zlib-derived open source license
that allows commercial or non-commercial use.  The environment is
intended to lower both the cost and complexity of microcontroller embedding 
by using the capabilities of the new generation of 32-bit self-contained
microcontrollers from NXP, Atmel, and Microchip.  Jumentum-SOC is
excellent to help teach how to integrate microcontrollers into projects
as well as a means of automating simple projects.
