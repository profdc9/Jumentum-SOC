Configuration file parameters



PASSWORD=password

Configures a password for the web server and the telnet server.


STARTUP=y or n

Enables starting the BASIC program with one or two seconds on reset.  Otherwise,
the program will start after a 10 to 20 second delay.


WATCHDOG=y or n

Enables the watchdog feature that resets the processor if the watchdog is
not fed for 10 seconds.  Under normal circumstances, the watchdog is fed
automatically by the system and will only reset if it crashes or locks up.


DHCP=y or n

Configures whether the controller attempts to use DHCP to configure the
IP address of the unit.  If the unit is not able to acquire an address after
a couple minutes, it defaults to the values given by HOSTADDR/NETMASK/ROUTER.


HOSTADDR=<ipaddr> e.g. 10.0.0.4

Configures the IP address of the unit.  If DHCP is enabled, the unit first
attempts to use DHCP to acquire an address, otherwise it uses this value.
If HOSTADDR is not specified, the default is 10.0.0.4.


NETMASK=<netmask> e.g. 255.255.255.0

Configures the netmask of the unit.  If DHCP is enabled, the unit first uses
DHCP to acquire the netmask, otherwise this value is used.  If NETMASK is not
specified, the default is 255.0.0.0.


ROUTER=<router> e.g. 10.0.0.1

Configures the default router (also called gateway) for the unit to use.  First
attempts to acquire by DHCP if DHCP is enabled.  If ROUTER is not specified,
the default is 10.0.0.1


SMTP=<smtp server address>

Configures the address of the SMTP server to send mail to.


HOSTNAME=<hostname>

Configures the host name that appears in outgoing E-mails.


TELNETPORT=<port #>

Configures the port number to use for the telnet server.  Defaults to 23.


HTTPPORT=<port #>

Configures the port number to use for the web server.   Defaults to 80.



Other data can be placed into the configuration file, and can be read with
the CONF$ function from Basic, so that one can avoid modifying the Basic
program itself if one wishes to modify its behavior.
